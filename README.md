# 🍕 [GodEats](https://github.com/godeats/sep3) Source Code
This repository contains Source Code for *GodEats* , a project developed by **Dimitrian, Mark , Satish and Daniel**, during the SEP3 2021 course at **VIA UC**.

## 💫 Abstract:
There is a need for a healthy food delivery service on the market. The
“GodEats” project was developed to try to address this issue, a project which
would supposedly deliver ingredients for healthy food to be cooked at home.
The three tier architecture was used with a presentation tier for which C# and
the Blazor Framework was utilized, a business tier, for which C# was used and
its WebApi functionality, and a data tier, for which Java and the Spring
framework was used, together with Hibernate ORM and SQLite database.
The networking technologies used were REST over HTTPS for inter tier
communication and SignalR for the live-chat functionality.
The resulting product is a web-application that is able to handle user
orders and with small improvement would be able to work in production.
